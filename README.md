# Aurora

## Introduction

Aurora is an open-source web application designed for easy and magical music creation. It extends the concept of melody mixing to allow users to generate musical melodies, harmonies, percussions onto layers, composing them into a complete track using AI.

## Features

- AI-powered melody generation
- Interactive interface for mixing different music layers
- User-friendly design for musicians and non-musicians alike
- Support for various music genres

## Getting Started

To get started with Aurora, clone the repository and follow the setup instructions:

```bash
git clone [your-repository-link]
cd Aurora
# Add setup instructions here
```

## Usage

## Inspiration

This project started as a hackathon idea: Can I provide a web application to generate unique music? It doesn't need to be like a 5 minute masterpiece, but something that users could use to create something themselves and sounds awesome.

Research lead me to an [article from 2018 by Torin Blankensmith](https://medium.com/@torinblankensmith/melody-mixer-using-deeplearn-js-to-mix-melodies-in-the-browser-8ad5b42b4d0b) and a project called [Melody Mixer](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/ai/melody-mixer/view/). After tinkering with it, I knew this concept
and this simplicity was what I wanted to model Aurora after. But I wanted to take it even further...

## AI Journey

This project is inspired by AI. I used ChatGPT to solve many of the problems and questions I had along the way. I used it fully as my assistant to build this project, to give me guidance on what features to add, etc. I'm not sure how I'm going to document this, but I will be providing my complete chat history with ChatGPT on how I used it to build this application.
